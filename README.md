# Welcome to My Ngram
***

## Task
The problem is to count the number of times an occurrence appears in a string argument. the challenge is to do it using a makefile, and an ente te file in c

## Description
To solve the problem, I used two procedures. One that will insert each character of the string into an array of integers. and another which will count the number of times an occurrence appears

## Installation
Normally the project is on github so you will have to download it. no npm to use.

## Usage
After downloading you will need a text editor like svcode to compile the program.
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
